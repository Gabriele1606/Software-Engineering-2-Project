## Problem assignments
You are to develop a digital management system for a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars. 
First, the system should provide the functionality normally provided by car-sharing services.<br /> <br />
These include:<br />
* Users must be able to register to the system by providing their credentials and payment information. 
They receiveback a password that can be used to access the system.<br />
* Registered users must be able to find the locations of available cars within a certain distance from their 
current location or from a specified address.<br />
* Among the available cars in a certain geographical region, users must beable to reserve a single car for up to one hour 
before they pick it up.<br />
* If a car is not picked-up within one hour from thereservation,thesystemtags thecarasavailableagain, andthereservation expires; 
the user pays a fee of 1 EUR.<br />
* A user that reaches a reserved car must be able to tell the system sheâ€™s nearby, so the system unlocks the car and the user 
may enter.<br />
* As soon as the engine ignites, the system starts charging the user for a given amount of money per minute; the user is 
notified of the current charges through a screen on the car.<br />
* The system stops charging the user as soon as the car is parked in a safe area and the user exits the car; 
at thispoint, the system locks the car automatically.<br />
* The set of safe areas for parking cars is pre-defined by the management system.<br /><br />

## Documents to be created
